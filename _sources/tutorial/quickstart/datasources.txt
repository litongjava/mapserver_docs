   MapServer
   supports vector data formats other than ESRI's Shapefile format
   through the use of OGR library (part of the GDAL software package).
   Please visit the GDAL project web site at
   `<http://gdal.osgeo.org/>`_ and read
   `<http://gdal.osgeo.org/ogr/>`_ to learn more about the different
   vector formats MapServer supports.  In addition, Jeff McKenna and
   Tyler Mitchell have written a detailed :ref:`guide to using vector
   data for MapServer <vector>`.

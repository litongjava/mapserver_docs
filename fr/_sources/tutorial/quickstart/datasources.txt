Using Different Datasources
===========================

   MapServer
   supports vector data formats other than ESRI's Shapefile format
   through the use of OGR library (part of the GDAL software package).
   Please visit the GDAL project web site at
   `<http://gdal.osgeo.org/>`_ and read
   `<http://gdal.osgeo.org/ogr/>`_ to learn more about the different
   vector formats MapServer supports.  In addition, Jeff McKenna and
   Tyler Mitchell have written a detailed :ref:`guide to using vector
   data for MapServer <vector>`.

   **SHAPEPATH**
   This is the path to your data layers. You can provide absolute
   paths (i.e. "/ms4w/apps/tutorial/data" or
   "C:/ms4w/apps/tutorial/data") or paths relative to your mapfile's
   location (in this example, you'd use "../data"). This path doesn't
   have to be web accessible, and probably shouldn't be unless you
   want anyone to download your raw data. It has nothing directly to
   do with the web so don't even think of URLs here.  Just make sure
   that the user running the web server (usually "nobody" or "apache"
   in the \*nix world) can READ the data in the SHAPEPATH.

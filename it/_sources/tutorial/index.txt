This tutorial was designed to give new users a quick (relatively
speaking) introduction to the concepts behind MapServer. It is
arranged into four sections with each section having one or more
examples and increasing in complexity.  Users can jump to any section
at any time although it is recommended that absolute beginners work on
the first three sections sequentially.

Section one focuses on basic MapServer configuration concepts such as
layer and class ordering, using vector and raster data, projections
and labeling.  Section two provides examples on how to use HTML
templates to create a simple interface for an interactive web mapping
application. Section three introduces the use of HTML templates to
provide a "query" interface. Finally, section four introduces some
advanced user interface concepts.
